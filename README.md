### Hello Everyone 👋

I'm Carlos Medina, Software & Web Engineering by Uniovi where I was also Lecturer and I'm currently finishing my PhD.

All my life I have been interested in Websites from different points of view, not only technological ones. Things like creativity, communication, or marketing are things around every success story that must not be forgotten in this tech environment. This passion motivates me to participate in different IT initiatives, such as Gamelab, an international videogames event for industry and business (from 2010 to 2016), or Neozink, a creative design agency to use technological tools for boosting your business (from 2013 to 2021).

My motivation for using communication for a better understanding of every context made me put a lot of effort into people, and this is the reason why I joined DocPlanner at the beginning of 2022 because I wanted to learn more about different people, cultures, and ways of work. Same with Iktomi, where I am currently working as Senior Digital Project Manager.

Additionally, I am or was also responsible for some different projects:
- 🤺 Kendo Vetusta: I am the founder and one of the trainers of the Club. As 4th Dan of Kendo, I have been training for almost 20 years [kendo-oviedo.com]( Website)
- 🍃 Herbonatura: I am the founder of this eCommerce of products 100% Eco and Natural. It has been launched in 2013 and since then we have received thousands of orders [herbonatura.es](Website)
- 🏋️ Basati CrossFit: I was one of the 4 founders of this initiative in 2018, and after a year of working hard, I left the project because of the distance (300km away from my home)
- ⚫ Dot is Line: A personal project about empowering leaders to be more authentic, through text messages in social media.

My values are wellness, passion, and curiosity and they are strongly connected to the mottos: "Protecting My Devotion" and "More is not better. Better is Better". This is because I think that without imagination anything is possible, and without quality, any idea never grew up properly.
