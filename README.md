### Hello Everyone 👋

I'm Carlos Medina, Software & Web Engineering by Uniovi and currently Lecturer and PhD Candidite in this university as well. 

All my life I have been interested in Websites from differents points of view, not only technological. Thinks like creativity, communication or marketing are things around every sucess story that must not be forgotten in this tech environment. This passion motivates me to participate in different IT initiatives, such as Gamelab, an international videogames event for industry and business (from 2010 to 2016), or Neozink, a creative design agency with the purpose of using technological tools for boosting your business (from 2013 to 2021).

My motivation of using communication for a better understanding of every context made me put a lot of effort in people, and this is the reason why I joined DocPlanner in the beginning of 2022, because I wanted to learn more about different people, cultures and ways of work.

Additionally, I am also responsible of some different projects:
- 🤺 Kendo Vetusta: I am the founder and actually one of the trainers of the Club. As 4th Dan of Kendo, I have been training for almost 20 years [kendo-oviedo.com]( Website)
- 🍃 Herbonatura: I am the founder of this eCommerce of products 100% Eco and Natural. It has been launched in 2013 and since then we have received thousands of orders [herbonatura.es](Website)
- 🏋️ Basati CrossFit: I was one of the 4 founders of this initiative in 2018, and anfter a year of working hard, I left the project because of the distance (300km away from my home)

My mottos are "Protecting My Devotion" and "More is not better. Better is Better". And this is because I think that without imagination anything is possible, and without quality any idea never grew up properly.
